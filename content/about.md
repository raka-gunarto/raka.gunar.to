# About

Hi, I'm **Raka Gunarto**, a software engineer. I have been interested in computers since
I was barely conscious (10 years old?). The earliest recollection of my curiosity was looking at 
the magic box that showed things on a monitor. Not much later, I asked my dad about
Excel macros while he was working on a spreadsheet. From there, I began my deep dive into
the world of software, and I've only scratched the surface of what there is to explore. 

I frequently create things in my spare time, many of which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/raka-gunarto)

## What I Do

I'm currently in my early career as a software engineer. I love learning new things, and finding 
new people to learn new things from.

My current role is at EnQuest, where I work as a software engineer within an operations
focused organisation. In practice, this means taking end-to-end ownership of internal engineering
work. I work on various projects which ranges from building AI assisted search with their data
to experimenting with machine learning to assist in their operations.

More broadly, I enjoy working on (positively) impactful wide-reaching projects alongside
a high-performing team. I want to work alongside truly passionate people who care about
doing things right and continuous improvement.

## Background

I studied an MEng in Computer Science at the University of Leeds, where I graduated with a first.
Alongside the formal curriculum, I took opportunities to go further than the syllabus in topics
that interested me. Notably, I took a deep interest in the operating systems module, where I 
implemented a [subset of mmap](https://github.com/raka-gunarto/xv6-mmap) in xv6 to share memory pages, and later on wrote a [toy
graphics driver](https://github.com/raka-gunarto/uol-bsc-project) for xv6 for my BSc project. I also took an interest in graphics programming,
where I spent a winter break writing a [mini game engine](https://github.com/raka-gunarto/COMP3811-CW2-GameEngine) for an assignment. 

In addition to the academics, I loved helping my peers and sharing my knowledge, spending my time in labs
helping other students and later becoming a teaching assistant. I was awarded the BIT94 prize
in computing, which is "awarded to the student who does most to foster good interaction of either
an academic or social nature between staff and students in the School of Computing".

Before and during university, I worked on a mix of personal projects, hackathons, and part-time roles,
which eventually led to an internship and then a full-time role at Microsoft, working on telecoms
infrastructure in the cloud. 

Since then, I’ve focused on learning from strong engineering cultures and working alongside 
the best minds in the field.

## Interests

If you were to ask me my top three areas of interest, it would be:

- Low-level (OS kernels, drivers, etc.)
- Large-scale distributed systems (reliability, fault tolerance, and real-world scaling)
- Graphics programming (OpenGL, Vulkan, etc)

I am also very fond of open source, which I believe truly embodies the values I hold 
dear: the desire to create great things and share it for all. The
linux kernel project is something I have great respect for, it runs a majority of
the systems in the world, and many contributors are just passionate people
with spare time.

People in general that care deeply about their craft, software or something else entirely,
also interest me.
